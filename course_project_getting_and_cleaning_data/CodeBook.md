## Data set tidyMeans

This data set is created as part of the Course Project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data'. The name of the data set is 'tidyMeans'. See README.md on how to (re)create the data set. 

## Subject and Activity

These variables identify each records as a unique combination of a subject and an activity:

 - Subject: 
      Subject ID (int)
 - Activity: 
      Activity Description (factor) 
      6 levels:
        - Laying 
        - Sitting
        - Standing
        - Walking
        - Walking Upstairs
        - Walking Downstairs

## Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each combination of a subject and an activity. All measures have the prefix Mean in the variable name to indicate that they are the mean for a certain measurement. All values are floating point numbers (num).
